== Description ==

This is a WordPress widget to display the latest blog posts. From the functionality point of view, this widget is just like the standard Recent Posts widget, but with additional functionality: a sharing  button to Facebook or Twitter. This button is rendered before the post link, and by default it is configured to show the counter of how many time a particular post is shared in Facebook or Twitter. The presence of this button should entice your readers to share an interesting post in a social media website like Facebook and Twitter.

The 'sharing' button is configurable in widget administration screen: you can choose either Facebook or Twitter, but not both. The Facebook sharing button is an official button from Facebook API. The Twitter 'retweet' button is taken from Tweetmeme Retweet Button. Either one is small enough to fit into the limited area in latest posts list.
